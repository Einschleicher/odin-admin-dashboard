Now that Iâ€™ve had plenty of practice using Grid, I'm going to build a full dashboard design.

#### Self-reflection

*Exciting project, it feels like I favor grid over flexbox. For one case I used flexbox in this project: to adjust some problems with the 100vh height of the body, causing the right content bar with auto grid sizes to stretch. With flexbox I could easy stretch just the background instead of the card-containers. Not sure if there is a good solution for this in grid (as long as the grid-size stays on auto-size).*
